# Gitlet_proj
### A project for Data Structures and Algorithms.
Gitlet In this project you'll be implementing a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. Ours is smaller and simpler, however, so we have named it Gitlet.

The project involves creating a version control system which mimics some of the basic features of Git, as well as some additional features. 

The features implemented are init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge.


### A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

* Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called commits.
* Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.
* Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.
* Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.
* Merging changes made in one branch into another.
